# Reflection:
## 1. Identify any challenges or issues you encountered while writing your functions.
- Input Validation: Ensuring that inputs are correct was hard, especially in functions like "get_balance" and "user_selection,"
- Error Handling: Making sure the right inputs are used was tough
- Integration Testing: Writing each function and test was fairly easy, but making them work together smoothly in the chatbot needed extra thought about special cases and how users might interact with it.
## 2. Discuss the benefits and challenges of developing and using unit tests.
- Detecting Bugs Early: Tests help find errors before they cause bigger problems.
- Confidence in Refactoring: Tests ensure changes don't break existing code.
- Documentation: Tests act as examples and documentation for how functions should work.
